# Mods Bugtracker

**This repository was created to compensate for the limitations of Nexus Mods' built-in bug reporting system.** That system often ends up cluttered with incomplete or unusable reports because of missing context, vague descriptions, or the inability to attach logs directly. Since I care deeply about the stability and reliability of my mods, I make it a point to investigate every bug report. However, this also means I waste a significant amount of time chasing down issues that could've been resolved instantly if the right information had been provided.

On top of that, false or misleading reports tend to pile up, which confuses other users and gives the impression that my mods are unstable when, in fact, they may not be. This dedicated bug tracker is meant to clean up that mess and streamline the debugging process by enforcing a structured and detailed reporting workflow.

## ✅ What this repository **IS** for

- **Reporting reproducible bugs** in any mod created or maintained by myself.
- Providing clear information: mod version, Skyrim version, steps to reproduce, logs, etc.
- Following the issue templates – if you ignore them, your report may be closed without response.

## 🚫 What this repository is **NOT** for

- **No feature requests** – This is not a place to pitch ideas or ask for new features.
- **No support requests** – If you have installation issues or mod conflicts, use appropriate modding forums (like Nexus Mods or Discord).
- **No drama or off-topic posts** – Keep it technical, relevant, and respectful.

## ⚠️ Before reporting

Please make sure you've done the following:

- You're using the **latest version** of the mod.
- You've read the mod's description, any known issues, the FAQ, and the Troubleshooting section (if available, it can be found in the pinned message of the mod's comment section on Nexus Mods).
- You've tried to **reproduce the bug** in a clean environment (no 300 other mods muddying the waters).
- You're not reporting something already listed in the [Issues](https://github.com/Seb263/SkyrimSE_ModBugReports/issues) tab.

## 📋 How to report a bug

Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Seb263/SkyrimSE_ModBugReports/issues/new/choose), then click on **"New Issue"**. Select the relevant mod and fill out all the fields with as many details as possible. Reports that do not follow the guidelines mentioned earlier will be deleted.
