# Code of Conduct for Bug Reports on Seb263's Mods

## Purpose

To keep things clean, fair, and respectful, this code of conduct outlines the expected behavior for anyone submitting a bug report. Bug tracking is here to help improve the mods, not to host drama, harassment, or pointless arguments.

## Standards

Expected behavior includes:

- Using clear, respectful, and constructive language
- Staying on topic and focused on the technical issue
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting feedback when your report is incomplete or inaccurate
- Understanding that everyone’s time is valuable

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Using sexualized or aggressive language
- Trolling, personal attacks, or political arguments
- Harassment or stalking (public or private)
- Sharing private or identifying information without permission
- Repeatedly submitting false, vague, or deliberately misleading reports

## Responsibility

As the sole maintainer of this bug tracker, I reserve the right to edit, lock, delete, or reject any issue, comment, or contribution that violates this code of conduct. I may also block users from interacting with this repository if their behavior is clearly disruptive, abusive, or wasting time.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all interactions in this repository, including issues, comments, and any linked communications regarding the mods listed here.

## Enforcement

To report a serious violation of this code, you can send a message directly to me through GitHub or any contact method listed in the repository. Reports will be reviewed and acted on at my discretion. No public drama, no debates — just keeping things clean and functional.
